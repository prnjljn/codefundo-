Planning to make a app  that show the real time natural disaster happening aroung the world available by the "Global Disaster Alert and Coordination System".It will show the latest disasters like earthquakes, volcano, tsunamis and floods. It will also show the alert level for all the disasters. It will use the user's location and send them alert if any disaster is in nearby range of the user. We will also provide the option for users to give information about the disasters in the real time. 

Also planning to include a chat function in the app that uses the combined signal of wifi and bluetooth to form an ad hoc network that allows one to send and  receive messages at the time of disaster(when internet do not work).The signal range is limited but more and more people connect we could increase the potential range.This can help people in communicating with each other in disaster.
